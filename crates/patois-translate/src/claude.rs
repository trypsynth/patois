//! Machine translation through the Claude API.
//!
//! This replaces a dedicated machine-translation API, and the reason is not price. A
//! translation endpoint takes a string and a target language and nothing else, which for a
//! gettext catalog throws away most of what the catalog knows. Three things were being lost:
//!
//! - The `#. TRANSLATORS:` comments. Every one of them was written to disambiguate a string
//!   that can't be translated correctly without it ("Ready" the status, not "Ready" the
//!   button), and there was no field to put them in. There are ~30k characters of them.
//! - The `&` accelerator markers. A translation API sees punctuation and drops or relocates
//!   it, and nothing downstream checks: 216 of Russian's 251 accelerator strings had lost
//!   theirs, so most of the Russian menu had no keyboard access at all.
//! - The `\tCtrl+O` shortcut suffixes, which are UI wiring rather than prose and must survive
//!   byte-for-byte.
//!
//! A model can be told about all three, and the checks at the bottom of this file verify it
//! did rather than trusting it. Anything that fails a check is returned as `None` and left for
//! the next run, which is the same contract the previous backend had for placeholder damage.
